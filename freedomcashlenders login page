In the long run, you will want to improve your access to loans by building credit. One effective strategy is to take a credit builder loan from a credit union or online provider.

A credit builder loan is a secured loan product in which a lender funnels your loan proceeds into an escrow account. You then make monthly payments just as you would for a conventional loan. The lender will report your payments to all three major credit bureaus, which should raise your credit score over time. The lender will return the escrowed money to you when you finish repaying the loan.

If you’re unable to make the payments on your credit builder loan, the lender will close the account and refund your money without any credit score damage. These loans can only help your credit — never hurt it.
