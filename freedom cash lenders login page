Yes, a direct lender will check your credit when you apply for a personal loan. But the lender-matching services do not pull your credit when they attempt to prequalify your loan request.

Because they don’t check your credit report, you can apply to one of these lending networks without immediately impacting your credit score. Only when you are preapproved for a loan and apply to a direct lender will you undergo a credit check.

A credit check shouldn’t discourage you from applying to any of the reviewed lending networks because the participating direct lenders serve borrowers with poor credit. These lenders typically don’t impose stringent credit score requirements on their applicants.

In any event, your credit score is just one factor in a lender’s decision to offer you a loan. For example, the lender will want to see if you have a history of missing monthly payments. Multiple late payments are a red flag that tells the lender you are a high-risk borrower.

In this case, the lender will likely charge a high interest rate on the loan, reduce the loan amount, or simply decline your application.
